## About Me

I'm a BTech Computer Science Engineering student at **Lovely Professional University** (Class of 2029), driven by a philosophy of self-reliance in technology. When I see a proprietary tool or product, my first instinct is to understand how it works and build my own version. I don't like depending on others' tools â€” I'd rather create, self-host, and truly own my solutions.

Currently, I'm exploring cloud infrastructure, full-stack development, and building practical tools that solve real-world problems. I'm at the beginning of my journey, learning by doing, and committed to understanding technology at a fundamental level rather than just using it superficially.

**Core Interests:**
- Cloud & Infrastructure Development
- Full Stack Web Development
- Building Self-Hosted Solutions
- Developer Tools & Automation

**Philosophy:** If I need a tool, I build it. If I see technology, I learn how it works. Independence through understanding.
